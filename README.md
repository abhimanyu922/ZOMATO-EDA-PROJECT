    In this project, you are working as a <strong>Data Analyst / Data Scientist</strong> at Zomato, 
    where data plays a critical role in shaping strategic decisions and improving customer experience. 
    You are provided with a real-world dataset of customers and restaurants.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project involves the <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> of Zomato data to gain insights into restaurant trends, 
    customer preferences, and other relevant information. Your objective is to perform a detailed EDA to answer the following business questions:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?</li>
    <li>How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?</li>
    <li>What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?</li>
    <li>Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?</li>
    <li>Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?</li>
    <li>Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?</li>
  </ol>
